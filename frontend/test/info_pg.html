    Anybody can get HIV. HIV is a virus; once it gets into your body, it can make you sick. 
	It does so if you are rich or poor; 14 years old or 70; black or white; gay or straight; married or single. 
	It's what you do, not who you are, that puts you at risk for HIV.

<a href="#4th" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">How Long Does It Take to Feel a Symptom of HIV?</a>
</div>

<div id="4th" class="collapse content-center">
    People can have HIV for 10 years or more and never show any symptoms. Other people can get symptoms within a 
	short time after being infected. The only way you can tell if you have HIV is to get an HIV test.

<a href="#5th" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse">How Long Will I Live With HIV?</a>
<div id="5th" class="collapse">
    If you keep your CD4 (type of white blood cell) count up, keep your viral load down, take your HIV meds properly 
	and live a healthy life, there's no reason to think that your life will be any shorter with HIV than it would have 
	been without it. The latest information on life expectancy for HIVers shows that HIV-positive people who are on 
	treatment can expect to live well into their 60s and beyond -- and the estimates keep getting closer to those of 
	HIV-negative people as HIV meds become more and more effective.

<a href="#6th" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse">What Should a Person Do After They Test Positive?</a>
<div id="6th" class="collapse">
    If you've already tested positive for HIV, then there are tests a doctor can do to see whether your HIV is progressing, 
	and whether it's wise to start taking HIV medications.

	For most people, if HIV treatment is not started when their doctor recommends it (i.e., when their CD4 count is low or 
	their viral load is high), eventually their immune system will weaken to the point that they may develop life-threatening 
	health problems.

	If you're newly diagnosed, it can also be incredibly beneficial if you seek out support, get help from your local HIV 
	organization and connect with other HIV-positive people.

<a href="#7th" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse">What is HIV Testing?</a>
<div id="7th" class="collapse">
    HIV testing tells you if you are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most of 
	these tests look for "antibodies" to HIV. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight a specific 
	germ. Newer HIV tests can also look for signs of the virus itself in the blood.
</div>

<br></br>

<a href="#8th" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse">How do I get tested?</a>
<div id="8th" class="collapse">
    You can arrange for HIV testing at any Public Health office, or at your doctor's office. Test results are usually available within two weeks.

	The most common HIV test is a blood test. Newer tests can detect HIV antibodies in mouth fluid (not the same as saliva), 
	a scraping from inside the cheek, or urine. "Rapid" HIV test results are available within 10 to 30 minutes after a sample is taken. 
	In 2012, the FDA approved the first true "in-home" HIV test. It uses a mouth swab and shows results in 20 to 40 minutes. A positive 
	result on any HIV test should be confirmed with a second test at a health care facility.
</div>

<a href="#9th" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse">When Should I Get Tested?</a>
<div id="9th" class="collapse">
    If you are infected with HIV, it usually takes from three weeks to two months for your immune system to produce HIV antibodies. 
	During this "window period" you can test "negative" for HIV even if you are infected. If you think you were exposed to HIV, you should 
	wait for two months before being tested. You can also test right away and then again after two or three months. If you are infected, you 
	can transmit HIV to others during the window period even if you test negative. In fact, during this period of early infection, you have the 
	greatest chance of passing HIV infection to others.

	About 5% of people take longer than two months to produce antibodies. Testing at 3 and 6 months after possible exposure will detect almost all 
	HIV infections. However, there are no guarantees as to when an individual will produce enough antibodies to be detected by an HIV test. If you 
	have any unexplained symptoms, talk with your health care provider and consider re-testing for HIV.
