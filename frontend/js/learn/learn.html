      <div class="collapse  element">
        Common HIV tests look for signs of the virus in your blood or check your oral fluids for low levels of antibodies.

      <a class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">Where can I get tested?</a>
      <div class="collapse  element">
        HIV tests are provided at any Public Health office, or at your doctor's office. Test results are usually available within two weeks.

        The most common HIV test is a blood test. Newer tests can detect HIV antibodies in mouth fluid (not the same as saliva), 
        a scraping from inside the cheek, or urine. "Rapid" HIV test results are available within 10 to 30 minutes after a sample is taken. 
        In 2012, the FDA approved the first true "in-home" HIV test. It uses a mouth swab and shows results in 20 to 40 minutes. A positive 
        result on any HIV test should be confirmed with a second test at a health care facility.

      <div class="collapse  element">

        A positive test result means that you are infected with the HIV virus; testing positive does NOT necessarily mean that you have AIDS.
        Many people who test positive stay healthy for several years, even if they don't start taking medication right away.

        It is strongly recommended that you take your HIV medication regularly. If you have been on HIV medication for a long time, however, and the virus is completely suppressed in your body, then it typically takes 7-10 days for the virus to rebound. Is is especially important to take your medication regularly at the start of your treatment, before the virus has been suppressed.
