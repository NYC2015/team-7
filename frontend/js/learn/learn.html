<div id="rand" class="collapse content-center element">
    AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome:

Acquired means you can get infected with it.
Immune Deficiency means a weakness in the body's system that fights diseases.
Syndrome means a group of health problems that make up a disease.
AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. If you get 
infected with HIV, your body will try to fight the infection. It will make "antibodies" special molecules to fight HIV.

You don't actually "get" AIDS. You might get infected with HIV, and later you might 
develop AIDS. You can get infected with HIV from anyone who's infected, even if they 
don't look sick and even if they haven't tested HIV-positive yet. The blood, vaginal 
fluid, semen, and breast milk of people infected with HIV has enough of the virus in it to infect other people.

	It does so if you are rich or poor; 14 years old or 70; black or white; gay or straight; married or single. 
	It's what you do, not who you are, that puts you at risk for HIV.

    If you keep your white blood cell count up, keep your viral load down, take your HIV meds 
	and live a healthy life, you can live a normal life. The life expectancy for HIV carriers 
	shows that HIV-positive people who are on treatment can expect to live well into their 60s 
	and beyond. These estimates keep getting closer to those of 
	HIV-negative people as HIV meds become more and more effective.

<div id="6th" class="collapse content-center element">
    If you're tested positive for HIV, then doctors can test to see whether your HIV is progressing, 
	and whether to start taking HIV medications.

	If HIV treatment is not started when their doctor recommends it (when their CD4 count is low or 
	their viral load is high), their immune system will weaken to the point that they may develop life-threatening 
	health problems.

	If you're newly diagnosed, it would be beneficial to seek out support, get help from your local HIV 
	organization and connect with other HIV-positive people.

<div id="7th" class="collapse content-center element">
    HIV testing tells you if you are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most of 
	these tests look for "antibodies" to HIV. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight a specific 
	germ. Newer HIV tests can also look for signs of the virus itself in the blood.

<a href="#8th" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">How do I get tested?</a>
<div id="8th" class="collapse content-center element">
    You can arrange for HIV testing at any Public Health office, or at your doctor's office. Test results are usually available within two weeks.

	The most common HIV test is a blood test. Newer tests can detect HIV antibodies in mouth fluid (not the same as saliva), 
	a scraping from inside the cheek, or urine. "Rapid" HIV test results are available within 10 to 30 minutes after a sample is taken. 
	In 2012, the FDA approved the first true "in-home" HIV test. It uses a mouth swab and shows results in 20 to 40 minutes. A positive 
	result on any HIV test should be confirmed with a second test at a health care facility.

<a href="#9th" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse">When Should I Get Tested?</a>
<div id="9th" class="collapse content-center element">
    If you're infected with HIV, it takes from three weeks to two months for your immune system to produce HIV antibodies. 
	During this "window period" you can test "negative" for HIV even if you are infected. If you think you were exposed to HIV, you should 
	wait for two months before being tested. You can also test right away and then again after two or three months. If you are infected, you 
	can transmit HIV to others during the window period even if you test negative. In fact, during this period of early infection, you have the 
	greatest chance of passing HIV infection to others.

	About 5% of people take longer than two months to produce antibodies. Testing at 3 and 6 months after possible exposure will detect almost all 
	HIV infections. However, there are no guarantees as to when an individual will produce enough antibodies to be detected by an HIV test. If you 
	have any unexplained symptoms, talk with your health care provider and consider re-testing for HIV.

<div id="10th" class="collapse content-center element">
     A positive test result means that you have HIV antibodies, and are infected with HIV. This can be a very difficult time.
	 Testing positive does not mean that you have AIDS. Many people who test positive stay healthy for several years, even if they don't start taking medication right away.

<div id="12th" class="collapse content-center element">
     Antibody test results for HIV are accurate more than 99.5% of the time. Before you get the results, the test has usually been done two or more times. The first test 
	 is called an "EIA" or "ELISA" test. Before a positive ELISA test result is reported, it is confirmed by another test called a "Western Blot."
