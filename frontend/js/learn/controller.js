	      type: "lists"},
	  {title: "Who gets HIV?",
	   description: "Anybody can get HIV. HIV is a virus; once it gets into your body, it can make you sick. It does so if you are rich or poor; 14 years old or 70; black or white; gay or straight; married or single. It's what you do, not who you are, that puts you at risk for HIV."},
	  {title: "How Long Does It Take to Feel a Symptom of HIV?",
	   description: "People can have HIV for 10 years or more and never show any symptoms. Other people can get symptoms within a short time after being infected. The only way you can tell if you have HIV is to get an HIV test."},
	  {title: "How Long Will I Live With HIV?",
	   description: "If you keep your CD4 (type of white blood cell) count up, keep your viral load down, take your HIV meds properly and live a healthy life, there's no reason to think that your life will be any shorter with HIV than it would have been without it. The latest information on life expectancy for HIVers shows that HIV-positive people who are on treatment can expect to live well into their 60s and beyond -- and the estimates keep getting closer to those of HIV-negative people as HIV meds become more and more effective."},
	  {title: "What Should a Person Do After They Test Positive?",
	   description: "If you've already tested positive for HIV, then there are tests a doctor can do to see whether your HIV is progressing, and whether it's wise to start taking HIV medications. For most people, if HIV treatment is not started when their doctor recommends it (i.e., when their CD4 count is low or their viral load is high), eventually their immune system will weaken to the point that they may develop life-threatening health problems."},
	  {title: "What is HIV Testing?",
	   description: "HIV testing tells you if you are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most of these tests look for 'antibodies' to HIV. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to fight a specific germ. Newer HIV tests can also look for signs of the virus itself in the blood."},
	  {title: "How do I get tested?",
	   description: "You can arrange for HIV testing at any Public Health office, or at your doctor's office. Test results are usually available within two weeks. The most common HIV test is a blood test. Newer tests can detect HIV antibodies in mouth fluid (not the same as saliva), a scraping from inside the cheek, or urine. 'Rapid' HIV test results are available within 10 to 30 minutes after a sample is taken. In 2012, the FDA approved the first true 'in-home' HIV test. It uses a mouth swab and shows results in 20 to 40 minutes. A positive result on any HIV test should be confirmed with a second test at a health care facility."},
	  {title: "When Should I Get Tested?",
	   description: "If you are infected with HIV, it usually takes from three weeks to two months for your immune system to produce HIV antibodies. During this 'window period' you can test 'negative' for HIV even if you are infected. If you think you were exposed to HIV, you should wait for two months before being tested. You can also test right away and then again after two or three months. If you are infected, you can transmit HIV to others during the window period even if you test negative. In fact, during this period of early infection, you have the greatest chance of passing HIV infection to others."},
	  {title: "Do Any Tests Work Sooner After Infection?",
	   description: "Viral load tests detect pieces of HIV genetic material. They show up before the immune system manufactures antibodies. In 2010 the FDA approved a new blood test that detects both antibodies to HIV and HIV antigens (pieces of the virus). This 'fourth generation' test can detect HIV infection sooner than antibody tests alone."},
	  {title: "What Does It Mean if I Test Positive?",
	   description: "A positive test result means that you have HIV antibodies, and are infected with HIV. Testing positive does not mean that you have AIDS. Many people who test positive stay healthy for several years, even if they don't start taking medication right away. If you test negative six months after you think you were exposed to HIV and if there is no chance you were exposed to HIV since then, you are not infected with HIV."}
