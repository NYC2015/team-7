Challenge statement

KCA is seeking your assistance to develop a range of possible prototypes for a youth-friendly mobile application
that can eventually move into the design phase with inputs from young people living with HIV in their programs.

KCA's hope is to launch this application in the countries where they work (and beyond!). KCA is open to creative suggestions
around the structure and components of the mobile application; however it should enable the following at a minimum:

- A forum for YLHIV to share experiences and provide support to each other about the realities of living with HIV and how to
live positively and confidently
- Basic, evidence-based information on HIV and sexual reproductive health
- A greater understanding of the resources and services available to young people locally for HIV care and psychological support
- A mechanism to reach out for assistance/advice from experts (for example, doctors and nurses trained in HIV clinical care and appointment reminders and daily medication reminders.
- Ability to remain "verified" but also stay anonymous, if preferred.
